# BookStoreSolution

This project is developped using Visual Studio 2019 Community and .Net framework 4.7. It contains three parts:

1. BookStore: a class library containing the business logic of book store
2. BookStoreTests: a unit test project which tests the BookStore project
3. BookStoreConsole: An optional console application which references the BookStore project 

To test BookStore:

1. Run the unit tests contained in the BookStoreTests project. 
2. We can also run the BookStoreConsole application to do some tests and display the results in the console window. 
Before launching the console project, don't forget to modify the file path of the two json files in the Programs.cs
